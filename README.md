# Investigating the Relationship Between Social and Sustainable Bonds and Homelessness

This repository contains the Python code used to investigate the relationship between social and sustainable bonds and homelessness, as well as the presentation slides summarizing the findings. The project was conducted by Joshua Spisak, a student studying business administration and computer science.

## Project Description
Homelessness is a complex social issue with various contributing factors such as lack of affordable housing, poverty, unemployment, mental health issues, and substance abuse problems. Addressing homelessness requires a comprehensive approach involving collaboration between government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and communities.

In this project, we focused on analyzing the relationship between social and sustainable bonds and homelessness. Social bonds are financial instruments designed to fund projects with positive social outcomes, while sustainable bonds finance environmentally sustainable projects. By channeling capital into these projects, the aim is to address societal challenges, including homelessness.

## Dataset
The project utilized a dataset stored in an Excel file named `research_project.xlsx`. The data includes information about bond issuances, state, year of issuance, the amount issued, as well as homelessness and population data obtained from the US Census Bureau and the Housing and Urban Development point-in-time count, respectively.

## Analysis
The Python code provided in this repository performs various regression analyses using the `statsmodels` library. The regressions examine the relationship between homelessness and social or sustainable bond issuances, both in terms of per capita values and percentage change.

The regression results indicate potential relationships between homelessness and sustainable bond issuance per capita, as well as between the percentage change in homelessness and social bond issuance per capita.

## Presentation Slides
The presentation slides summarizing the project findings are also included in this repository. The slides cover the following key points:
1. Introduction to the project and presenter background.
2. Overview of homelessness and its contributing factors.
3. Explanation of social and sustainable bonds and their role in responsible finance.
4. Reasons for choosing this project, including the presenter's involvement with a nonprofit fighting homelessness.
5. Process of data collection and analysis.
6. Description of the regression analyses performed in Python.
7. Emphasis on the 1-year lag used in the regressions.
8. Summary of significant regression results and their implications.
9. Acknowledgment of the limitations of social and sustainable bonds in addressing homelessness.
10. Suggestions for future research questions.
11. References used for data sources.
12. Acknowledgment of the presenter's mentor, Brian Gibbons.
13. Conclusion and gratitude to the audience.

Please refer to the presentation slides for a more detailed overview of the project and its findings.

## Usage
To run the Python code provided, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install pandas statsmodels` in your terminal.
3. Place the `research_project.xlsx` file in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Run the script using a Python IDE or by executing `python script.py` in your terminal.

The code will perform the regression analyses and print the results to the console.
